<p>By contrast, electricity for the drive train of the hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (fcev) is generated from hydrogen and oxygen in fuel cells housed within the vehicle itself. What you need to know but couldn�t ask. The performance, availability of refueling stations and price will definitely have to go the electric car’s way. Each fuel cell contains oxygen and hydrogen, and it can produce power for an indefinite amount of time. Hydrogen is an abundant and accessible element in the environment, found in water (h2o), hydrocarbons, and other organic matter. It is a clean fuel, producing no harmful tailpipe emissions.
