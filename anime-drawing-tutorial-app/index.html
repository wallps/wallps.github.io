<p>This is a tutorial for drawing and colouring anime/fantasy backgrounds on photoshop; ‎this is the best drawing app for learning and sharing. I had 150+ requests for a tutorial on hair and i originally planned on putting curly hair, spikes, buns, braids (french braids), bangs, long hair, short hair, pigtails, ponytails, ofuku (geisha), and odango in this tutorial. 5,000 tutorials for learning freely, 50,000 drawings submitted every month, 500,000 artists talk and share experience, 5,000,000 users downloaded over the world. Drawing anime doesn’t have to be complicated. I also wanted to say i’m really sorry if i disappointed anyone with making a tutorial on just bangs.
